# AnomRadar - Enhanced Features Update

## What's New? 🚀

AnomRadar has been significantly enhanced with **4 new scanner modules** and **comprehensive setup documentation** to make it even more amazing!

## New Scanner Modules (12 Total)

### 🆕 1. SSL/TLS Certificate Scanner
**What it does:**
- Validates SSL/TLS certificates
- Checks expiration dates (alerts 90, 30, and 0 days before expiry)
- Detects self-signed certificates
- Identifies weak algorithms (MD5, SHA1)
- Checks for wildcard certificates
- Detects weak SSL/TLS protocols (SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS 1.0/1.1)
- Identifies weak cipher suites

**Why it's important:**
- Expired or weak certificates can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks
- Self-signed certificates cause browser warnings
- Weak protocols and ciphers are vulnerable to attacks

**Example findings:**
- ⚠️ "SSL Certificate Expiring in 15 days"
- 🔴 "SSL Certificate uses weak algorithm: SHA1"
- 🟠 "Weak SSL/TLS Protocols Enabled: SSLv3, TLS 1.0"

---

### 🆕 2. WHOIS Scanner
**What it does:**
- Retrieves domain registration information
- Checks domain expiration dates
- Identifies registrar information
- Checks for WHOIS privacy protection
- Lists nameserver configuration
- Detects recently registered domains (< 30 days)
- Verifies domain lock status

**Why it's important:**
- Expired domains can be hijacked
- New domains may indicate phishing or scams
- Missing privacy protection exposes personal information
- Unlocked domains can be transferred without authorization

**Example findings:**
- 🔴 "Domain expires in 5 days"
- 🟡 "Recently Registered Domain (12 days old)"
- 🟠 "No WHOIS Privacy Protection"
- 🟠 "Domain Not Locked - enable transfer lock"

---

### 🆕 3. Social Media Presence Scanner
**What it does:**
- Scans websites for social media links
- Detects presence on 7+ platforms:
  - LinkedIn
  - Twitter/X
  - Facebook
  - Instagram
  - YouTube
  - TikTok
  - GitHub
- Checks for HTTPS vs HTTP links
- Identifies missing platforms
- Extracts social media URLs from meta tags

**Why it's important:**
- Social media is crucial for brand presence
- Missing platforms may mean missed opportunities
- HTTP links can be security risks
- Fake or inactive accounts can damage reputation

**Example findings:**
- ℹ️ "Social Media Presence Detected on 5 platforms"
- ℹ️ "LinkedIn Profile Found: linkedin.com/company/example"
- 🟡 "Insecure Social Media Link: Facebook uses HTTP"
- ℹ️ "Potential Missing Social Media: Instagram, TikTok"

---

### 🆕 4. Technology Stack Scanner
**What it does:**
- Identifies 30+ technologies including:
  - **CMS**: WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Magento, Shopify
  - **Frameworks**: React, Angular, Vue.js, jQuery, Bootstrap
  - **Languages**: PHP, ASP.NET, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, Django
  - **Analytics**: Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Hotjar
  - **CDN**: Cloudflare, Amazon CloudFront, Akamai
- Detects outdated versions (jQuery < 3.0, PHP < 7.4)
- Checks for vulnerable technologies
- Identifies version exposure in headers
- Detects debug/development mode
- Checks security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Finds exposed admin panels
- Detects credentials in HTML comments

**Why it's important:**
- Outdated software has known vulnerabilities
- Debug mode exposes sensitive information
- Missing security headers leave sites vulnerable
- Exposed admin panels are attack vectors
- Version information helps attackers

**Example findings:**
- 🔴 "Outdated Technologies: jQuery 2.1, PHP 5.6"
- 🔴 "Debug/Development Mode Enabled"
- 🟠 "Missing Security Headers: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options"
- 🟠 "Admin Panel Link Found: /wp-admin"
- 🔴 "Potential Credentials in HTML Comments"
- 🟠 "Technology Version Information Exposed"

## What Gets Scanned Now?

When you run a scan, AnomRadar now checks:

1. ✅ **Company Information** (YTJ registry)
2. ✅ **Domain Discovery** (multiple sources)
3. ✅ **DNS Records** (A, MX, DNSSEC)
4. ✅ **Email Security** (SPF, DMARC, DKIM)
5. ✅ **Website Security** (OWASP ZAP passive)
6. ✅ **Network Services** (Open ports, Nmap)
7. ✅ **Contact Information** (Emails, phones)
8. ✅ **🆕 SSL/TLS Certificates** (Validity, expiration, ciphers)
9. ✅ **🆕 Domain Registration** (WHOIS, expiration, registrar)
